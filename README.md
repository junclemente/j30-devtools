# Project: Dev Tools Domination

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

#### Project takeaways
* Inspect JavaScript code by turning on debugger in Console. Right-click on element. Then select 'Break on' and make a selection such as 'attribute modification'. This will show the jScript and pause at the line number.
* String interpolation in console.log using `%s`: `console.log("This is an %s string.", "interpolated");`
* `console.warn(msg)` shows warning in console.
* `console.error(msg)` shows error in console and gives a stack trace
* `console.info(msg)` Is now the same as console.log();
* `console.assert(test, msg)` If test fails, msg will be shown in the console.
* `console.clear()` Clears the console.
* `console.log(p)` Displays variable 'p'.
* `console.dir(p)` Allows to open up 'p' and view classList, dataset, children, etc...
* `console.group(x)` and `console.groupEnd(x)` to group output by 'x'.
* `console.groupCollapsed(x)` is same as console.group but defaulted to collapsed state.
* `console.count(x)` counts number of time 'x' is used
* `console.time(x)` and `console.timeEnd(x)` gives time of how long the function between the two took.
* `console.table(x)` displays array in a table
